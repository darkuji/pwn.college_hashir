# Intro to Arguments
### The challenge asks us to invoke an argument which is additional data which we pass along with a command


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{E5FMZR0F2oAeXTaWY5HHXag3L3l.QX4YjM1wSO1EzNzEzW}

First i executed the echo command along with an argument 'hello' which gave me the output as'hello'
just like a print statement. The 2nd time i executed echo hello hackers! which printed 'hello hackers!'
on the terminal
```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ echo hello
hello
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ echo hello hackers!
hello hackers!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E5FMZR0F2oAeXTaWY5HHXag3L3l.QX4YjM1wSO1EzNzEzW}

```

## What I Learned
I learned how Linux commands can take arguments which can be used to modify the code as needed. I also
learned how to use the 'echo' command which displays the argument passed on the terminal and works like
the print command in any programming language
