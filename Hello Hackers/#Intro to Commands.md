# Intro to Commands

### The challenge asks us to invoke the whoami command and the hello command in the terminal on pwn.college DOJO

## My Solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{suyhe36DbCmMPtYzb4fbLXVfYwc.QX3YjM1wSO1EzNzEzW}

First i executed the 'whoami' command which gave the output as 'hacker'. After termination, it again displays
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ after which i wrote the command 'hello' to obtain my flag.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{suyhe36DbCmMPtYzb4fbLXVfYwc.QX3YjM1wSO1EzNzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ 
```
