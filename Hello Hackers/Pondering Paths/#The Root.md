# The Root
### The challenge talks about how file locations work and asks us to use the /pwn command

## My Solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{wkMv77TN-usx59epgHTZszKt6qo.QX4cTO0wSO1EzNzEzW}

First I executed the /pwn command because the 'pwn' program was added directly under /
as its absolute path
```
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wkMv77TN-usx59epgHTZszKt6qo.QX4cTO0wSO1EzNzEzW}

```

## What I Learned
I learned about the absolute path of a program or a file in a Linux environment and 
how to invoke a program by entering its path on the command line
