# Catting Absolute Paths
### This challenge asks us to use the cat command to read a file by providing its absolute path


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{0d-Z_mqNMl-ShQnYRR4Mb5BjOcY.QX5ETO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
I first used the cat command and then passed the argument /flag which 
is the absolute path of the file where the flag is stored



```
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{0d-Z_mqNMl-ShQnYRR4Mb5BjOcY.QX5ETO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how in a Linux environment we can even use the absolute path of a file
as an argument in the cat command
