# Interrupting Processes
### The challenge asks us to interrupt a process


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{Iz1I6T5mEnW4BVAKS3xXx0iP8sk.QXzQDO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
Used Ctrl C to interrupt the process which wasn't giving me the flag
to obtain the flag


```
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember,
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
