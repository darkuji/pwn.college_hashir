# Chaining with semicolon
### The challenge asks us to write a chain of commands


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{IOe6SWoTyGmfqDy87oxKwBr5jx5.QX1UDO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
Used semicolon to write /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college in the same
line


```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IOe6SWoTyGmfqDy87oxKwBr5jx5.QX1UDO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I leaned how we can write multiple commands in the same line using semicolon
as a separator
