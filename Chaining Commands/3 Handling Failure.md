# Handling Failure
### The challenge asks us to chain using || operator


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{84YcljpcDjcrP4l-EyA9lSedqWT.01M0MDOxwSO1EzNzEzW}
Ran /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second so that either of them
can make the program run


```
hacker@chaining~handling-failure:~$ /challenge/first-failure || /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{84YcljpcDjcrP4l-EyA9lSedqWT.01M0MDOxwSO1EzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how the || works so that either of the commands chained can 
work like an OR gate
