# Building on success
### The challenge asks us to chain commands using &&


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{YUyoHt-8hXkYarEC4qxYZoxMxc3.0lM0MDOxwSO1EzNzEzW}
Used /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second so that the second
runs if the first succeeds



```
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$  /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{YUyoHt-8hXkYarEC4qxYZoxMxc3.0lM0MDOxwSO1EzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how we can chain commands using && and in this case the second
command runs only if the first one is executed successfully
