# Learning From Documentation
### The challenge asks us to use an argument along with the file path to get the flag


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{op5T8NFcMEkyRLLzFRZ8mosA7em.QX0ITO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
I used the --giveflag argument along with the file path to obtain the
flag

```
/hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{op5T8NFcMEkyRLLzFRZ8mosA7em.QX0ITO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how that sometimes in order  to invoke or execute a command 
properly we need to use a specific argument along with the file path which
in this case was --giveflag
