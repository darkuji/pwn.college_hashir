# Learning Complex Usage
### The challenge gives us documentation of a program and asks us to find the flag


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{gSINT57BSark7HOV4hquKN8zcm4.QX1ITO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
I first used ls to find the flag and then used the program /challenge/challenge
with the --printfile argument which requires another argument which in this case
was /flag



```
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile /flag
Correct argument! Here is the /flag file:
pwn.college{gSINT57BSark7HOV4hquKN8zcm4.QX1ITO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```

## What I Learned
I learned how arguments we give in a program can have more arguments for themselves
