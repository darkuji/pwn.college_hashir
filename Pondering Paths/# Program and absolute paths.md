# Program and absolute paths
### The challenge asks us to go into a program that is in another subfile 


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{s8sOqLMpFfQpI-tKQWQI3fKwjzX.QX1QTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}

I first used the /challenge part of the command to enter the challenge directory
and then the /run part to invoke the 'run' program which gives the flag



```
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{s8sOqLMpFfQpI-tKQWQI3fKwjzX.QX1QTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}

```
