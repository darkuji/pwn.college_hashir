# Setting Variables
### Challenge asks us to initialize variables


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{E8FmR4Nc7IhvXpOmoUNX3m4iS9n.QX5UTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}
Used the PWN=COLLEGE command to assign the value of COLLEGE to PWN


```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{E8FmR4Nc7IhvXpOmoUNX3m4iS9n.QX5UTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```
