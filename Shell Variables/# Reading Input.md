# Reading Input
### The challenge asks us to read input


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{wJ6LSthqSo_uFia_juaB9Ihgdxm.QX4cTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}
used read -p "INPUT " PWN to input the value to be stored in PWN.
Assigned COLLEGE value to get the flag


```
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT " PWN
INPUT COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{wJ6LSthqSo_uFia_juaB9Ihgdxm.QX4cTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```
