# Multi Word Variables
### The challenge asks us to assign multiple words to a variable


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{IOl_HKKOZE-JH0NpdoDazV1uBvB.QXwYTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}
Used PWN="COLLEGE YEAH" to assign that value to PWN


```
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{IOl_HKKOZE-JH0NpdoDazV1uBvB.QXwYTN0wSO1EzNzEzW}
```
