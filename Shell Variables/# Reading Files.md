# Reading Files
### The challenge asks us to read a program into a variable


## My Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{gl42rShO8B3jfAFZN4_uHfWUpXj.QXwIDO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
Used read PWN <  /challenge/read_me to get the flag


```
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN <  /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{gl42rShO8B3jfAFZN4_uHfWUpXj.QXwIDO0wSO1EzNzEzW}
